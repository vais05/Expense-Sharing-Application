##⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account and project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
# This project is already set up in your current directory
cd /path/to/project
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `server/.env` and add your Supabase credentials:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
PORT=3001
```

**Where to find Supabase credentials:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on "Settings" (gear icon) in the sidebar
3. Navigate to "API" section
4. Copy the "Project URL" for `SUPABASE_URL`
5. Copy the "service_role" key (NOT the anon key) for `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate back to project root
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 4: Database Setup

The database schema has already been created in your Supabase project. You can verify by:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Table Editor"
3. You should see tables: users, groups, group_members, expenses, expense_splits, settlements

##▶️ Running the Application

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers.

### Terminal 1 - Start Backend Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`

### Terminal 2 - Start Frontend Development Server
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL shown in terminal)

##🧠 How to Use the Application

### 1. Create Users
- First, create at least 2-3 users using the "Create New User" form
- Each user needs a name and email address
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e48d5ae-b076-441c-8aa9-941f3514e6c0" />

### 2. Select a User
- Use the "Current User" dropdown to select which user you're acting as
- This simulates switching between different user accounts
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dbc5c1d-3165-4585-bdea-d44fb6375350" />

### 3. Create a Group
- With a user selected, create a group using the "Create New Group" form
- Give it a name and optional description
- Select which users should be members of the group
- The creator is automatically added as a member
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7f28937-f66d-43d1-afc6-45ff40fb1b81" />

### 4. Add Expenses
- Select a group from the "Your Groups" list
- Click the "Expenses" tab (active by default)
- Use the "Add Expense" form to record a new expense
- Fill in:
  - Description (e.g., "Dinner at restaurant")
  - Amount (e.g., 100.00)
  - Split type (Equal, Exact, or Percentage)
  - Select members to split with
  - If using Exact or Percentage, enter the specific amounts/percentages
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/205aaff7-17d8-4718-8452-f6b605e8d5ca" />

### 5. View Balances
- Click the "Balances" tab
- **Group Balances**: Shows simplified balances between all group members
- **Personal Balances**: Shows what you owe and what others owe you across all groups
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26976864-aaf4-4a45-b8a2-43c03b6b755d" />

### 6. Settle Up
- In the "Balances" tab, use the "Settle Up" form
- Select who you're paying
- Enter the amount
- This records the payment and updates all balances automatically
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64d85b91-f8d4-45fb-80b4-8bb69bc3a74c" />

## Understanding Split Types

### Equal Split
Divides the total amount equally among selected members.
- Example: $100 split equally among 4 people = $25 each
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e83321d-9a3f-4fad-8aa6-7457c0518010" />

### Exact Amount
You specify exactly how much each person owes.
- The sum of all amounts must equal the total expense
- Example: $100 total - Person A owes $30, Person B owes $40, Person C owes $30
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef9d2e73-e98e-4ebe-aa99-e40ac0bf7393" />
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b10aeab4-d395-4040-b7b1-eb58870b2145" />

### Percentage Split
You specify what percentage each person owes.
- All percentages must add up to 100%
- Example: $100 total - Person A 50%, Person B 30%, Person C 20%
<img width="530" height="246" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61836075-5451-44a6-9630-838dac560e0b" />

##🏗️ Balance Calculation Logic

The application uses a sophisticated balance calculation algorithm:

1. **Expense Tracking**: When an expense is added, the system records who paid and how it was split
2. **Net Balances**: Balances between two users are simplified (if A owes B $50 and B owes A $30, result is A owes B $20)
3. **Settlement Impact**: When you record a settlement, it reduces the outstanding balance
4. **Real-time Updates**: All balances update immediately when expenses or settlements are added

##🧪 Testing the Application

### Example Scenario
1. Create users: Alice, Bob, Charlie
2. Login as Alice, create a group "Weekend Trip" with all three members
3. As Alice, add expense "Hotel" for $300, split equally
4. As Bob (switch user), add expense "Dinner" for $90, split equally
5. View balances - see who owes whom
6. As Charlie (switch user), settle up with Alice for $130

## Building for Production

### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Frontend
```bash
# From project root
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- **Port already in use**: Change `PORT` in `server/.env`
- **Database connection failed**: Verify Supabase credentials in `server/.env`
- **CORS errors**: Ensure frontend URL is correct in CORS configuration

### Frontend Issues
- **API connection failed**: Check that backend is running and `VITE_API_URL` is correct
- **Build errors**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### Database Issues
- **RLS Policy errors**: Ensure you're using the service_role key (not anon key) in backend
- **Missing tables**: Run the migration again or check Supabase dashboard

## ✅Assignment Requirements Checklist

-  Backend: Node.js with Express
-  Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
-  Create groups
-  Add shared expenses
-  Track balances
-  Settle dues
-  Equal split support
-  Exact amount split support
-  Percentage split support
-  Balance tracking (who owes whom)
-  User can see what they owe
-  User can see what others owe them
-  Simplified balances

## 🧩Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Backend and frontend are completely separate, communicating via REST API
2. **Database-First Approach**: All business logic calculations are done in application code, not in database
3. **Simplified Balances**: Net balances between users are calculated to show only the minimal transactions needed
4. **User Simulation**: Instead of authentication, users can switch between accounts to test different perspectives
5. **Real-time Updates**: All data refreshes after mutations to keep UI in sync
